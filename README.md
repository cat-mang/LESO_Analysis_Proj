# 1033 Program Analysis

## Motivation

## Exploratory Data Analysis

For this analysis I used 2 datasets.

### 1033 FOIA Dataset

The 1033 dataset had 243,492 rows and 8 columns. However, I noted that the datatset would likely be much bigger once I duplicated items that had Quantity values higher than 1.

### Police Fatality Dataset

The Police Fatality dateset had 28,335 rows and 29 columns.
